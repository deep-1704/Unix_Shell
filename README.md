# Unix_Shell

A custom built Unix shell supports all basic Unix commands and some self-made commands like history, greet, guide, and exit.

It also supports commands for executing an executable file, provided input and output files.\
For example: 
```bash
ubuntu@username:/Users/username>> myExe<input.txt>output.txt
```
## Run Locally

Before running, please make sure you are in a Unix-like environment (Mac/Linux(preferable)), as commands are based on Unix, and have installed GCC compiler for C-programs.

#### Steps

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/deep-1704/Unix_Shell.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Unix_Shell
```
Compile source code

```bash
  gcc MyCLI.c -o cli
```
Run the code

```bash

You are good to go!
